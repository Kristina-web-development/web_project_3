 Project 3 name: From Homeland to Homeland.

 Project discription:
 1) This project is about how to set screen size for :
     - 1280px and higher (standard laptops and beyond).
     - From 768px to 1280px (from a tablet in portrait to a standard laptop).
     - From 320px to 768px (from a large smartphone to a tablet in portrait).
     - Up to 320px (mobile devices).
 
 I learned a lot of technology and more about html and CSS. This site was developed using the Figma application.
 
 2) technology that i used for CSS, HTML:
    - grid and flex layouts
    - Media query for breakpoints 
    - BEM naming and file structure 
    - max-width to make the elements more flexible
    - didn't use height where possible 

 3) In the project I encountered the complexity of horizontal scrolling, I heeded to use the inter-interval screen width (for example: width: 540px, 480px). But i would like to learn how to do whithout additional width for the screen.    
 
 It was a very helpful experience!
